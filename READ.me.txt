This is my third attempt at trying to modularize the program.

Attempt 1
~~~~
The first attempt consisted of using an input csv format .txt file and outputting a graph.
I considered the first thousand primes and also the prime less than one million.

Attempt 2
~~~~
I then made a second attempt to use a very basic algorithm to calculate prime numbers
and this calculation method to output a csv fomrat .txt file. The output file could
was then input into the mapper

Attempt 3
~~~~
I have modularized the calculator with OOP principles (lacking documentation), although
it still uses a very basic recursive algorithm to find the primes; I am unsure of how
to create a proper sieve. However the mapper now uses the calculator as a class.



The gist of the mapper.

It takes an inclusive subset of an prime numbers and outputs the distribution of them
vs. the natural numbers. By inclusive I mean the set at minimum must be [2] and a set 
like [2,5] would be an invalid input, but [2,3,5] would not.

It also graph also has the line of y=1 drawn on as a line of interest.

If you have time to wait, please enter 7820, the natural number preceding 7819, the 1000th
prime number.

If you have more time, I would optimize the prime_number_calculator algorithm before entering
one million, although the graph will run given time if you so choose not to optimize.
